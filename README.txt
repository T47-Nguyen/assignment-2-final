Welcome to Clo_CloDry. In here, you have clean clothes and a close-up community. We are passionate about building a community of people over the shared necessity of doing laundry. People gather here to meet together, wash their clothes, get much-needed sustenance, swap stories, and build a real community. We've created a laundrette that you'll want to hang out in, and if you've yet to discover this Bristol gem, you've got a treat in store.

Say hello to Stellar, a slick little one-pager with a super vibrant color palette (which
I guess you can always tone down if it's a little too vibrant for you), a "sticky" in-page
nav bar (powered by my Scrollex plugin), a separate generic page template (just in case
you need one), and an assortment of pre-styled elements.
